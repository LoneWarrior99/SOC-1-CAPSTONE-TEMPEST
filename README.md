These are documents recording my journey through tryhackme's courses, specifically the SOC Level 1 Course. I had fun learning the responsibilites of a SOC Analyst and found enjoyment in completing each module. The course had a wide overview of industry tools and frameworks including labs and challenges. There was much insight to gain especially in their wireshark, snort, and splunk modules even though I already had an prior understanding of these tools. There were also new tools I had not handled yet such as Brim, Wazuh, and TheHive, which had a very helpful GUI to learn from.


Documented are rooms and capstone challenges I found useful or helpful in my journey to experience real world examples.
